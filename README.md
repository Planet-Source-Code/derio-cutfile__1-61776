### Description

I have some problems when sending eMail with a large file size as attachment. First, some mail server set a quota for that eMail. The second problem is coming when the recipient download the attachment. It takes long time to download, or when connection broken (because of time), he/she must re-download it, again and again. I imagine why we don&#8217;t create a program to cut the large file into peaces, and then send it one by one via eMail. After that you combine all of the attachments and become the original one.
